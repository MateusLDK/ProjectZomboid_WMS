# **PZ_WMS ‚Äì Warehouse Management System for Project Zomboid**  
*A smart storage solution to organize, track, and manage your survival supplies efficiently.*  

## **Overview**  
This mod introduces a **Warehouse Management System (WMS)** to Project Zomboid, allowing players to **digitally track stored items** across multiple shelves, **search for items quickly**, and **view inventory summaries** from a connected computer terminal.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Convert standard shelves into smart WMS-enabled storage** by adding scrap electronics.  
- **Assign custom addresses** (Storage, Street, Shelf) to each WMS Metal Shelf for easy navigation.  
- **Network-connected system** that aggregates storage data from all linked shelves in a building.  
- **Interactive computer terminal** to search for items, check stock levels, and locate stored goods.  
- **Power-dependent operation** ‚Äì shelves and computers require electricity to function.

## **Detailed Mechanics**  

### **1. Setting Up the WMS**  
- **Crafting WMS Shelves:**  
  - Combine **2x Scrap Electronics** with a **Large Metal Shelf** to convert it into a **WMS Metal Shelf**.  
  - Each shelf can be assigned a **custom address** (e.g., "Storage A, Street 1, Shelf 3").  

- **Network Connection:**  
  - All WMS shelves **within the same building** are automatically linked.  
  - Requires **power** to function‚Äîif electricity is cut, the system goes offline.  

### **2. Computer Terminal Interface**  
The connected computer provides **two main screens**:  

#### **üìä Total Storage (Network Overview)**  
- Displays **all items** stored across the network, **grouped by type** with total quantities.  
- **Search Function:**  
  - Players can **search for an item** (e.g., "Nails", "Canned Food").  
  - Results show **every shelf address** where the item is stored, along with quantities.  
- **Interactive Item List:**  
  - Clicking an item reveals **all locations** where it is stored.  

#### **üìç Address Storage (Shelf-Specific View)**  
- **Dropdown menu** to select a shelf by its **address** (Storage ‚Üí Street ‚Üí Shelf).  
- Shows **all items** in that specific shelf (read-only‚Äîno item transfers allowed).  

### **3. Power Requirements**  
- **WMS Shelves:**  
  - Consume a **small amount of power** when active.  
  - Lose functionality during blackouts.  
- **Computer Terminal:**  
  - Higher power consumption when **turned on**.  
  - Functions as the central hub for accessing the WMS network.

## **Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)**  
- **Remote Access:** Portable handheld terminal (like a PDA) to check WMS from anywhere ().
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Low stock warnings for critical items.

As a former logistics employee who setted up a few warehouses IRL, and a PZ warehouse organizer in multiplayer games, this mod is something i thought (and wished) after suffering for hours to find items for my friends in a giant warehouse! 
It is a WIP mod, and my first one, so please be patient! I will be working in this on my free time.
Let me know any ideas to improve it üöÄ
